## ISS position tracker

This is a frontend project that shows the current position of the International Space Station (ISS) relative to the Earth.
Each time the user clicks a button, the position of the ISS on the map will be updated.
By default, the map is centered to the middle of the terrestrial surface. 
The ISS is representedd by a red marker and by clicking it, a popup indicating the reported temperature of the zone(Â°C) at the time of the request will appear on top of the marker.


### Technologies

The project was developed on top of React.js and the information required for it to work was provided through two different APIs:
- http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ -> for the latitude and longitude of the ISS
- https://openweathermap.org/ -> weather API
