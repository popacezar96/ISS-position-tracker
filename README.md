## ISS position tracker

This is a frontend project that shows the current position of the International Space Station (ISS) relative to the Earth by clicking a button.
The position is representedd by a red marker on a map. When clicking the marker, a popup indicating the temperature of the zone(Â°C) reported at the time of the request will appear on top of the marker.

### Technologies
